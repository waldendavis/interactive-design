			A logo is more than images and words, a good logo tells a story about your company--who you are, what you do and what you stand for. That's a lot to ask of one piece of art, which is why it's important that you take the time to do it right. Fortunately, you don't have to do it alone. The steps below will take you through the process of designing a logo that will successfully brand you in the marketplace.

			<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Determine the primary function of your logo.</strong> A logo represents your brand through the use of shape, fonts, color and images. Being clear on why you need a logo can guide your design.

						<ul>
							<li>Boost recognition. Is your company new or competing in a field with a lot of other players? Having a strong logo can help clients recognize your brand more readily.</li>

							<li>Create memorability. Consumers shop with their eyes and logos can be easier to remember than names, products and services. Over time, a customer comes to associate your logo with your company.</li>

							<li>Create trust. Part of bringing in and keeping clients is based on their willingness to trust you. A solid logo that conveys your honesty and integrity can help put clients at ease.</li>

							<li>Enhance admiration. If clients already have a good impression of your business, you can build on that by creating a logo that is well-regarded for its good looks, cleverness or effective simplicity.</li>
						</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Think about your target market.</strong> It's important to be clear on who your client is and customize the look of your logo to appeal to those who will be using your services.

						<ul>
							<li>A logo for a florist shop could incorporate a whimsical font and a bright color scheme; this wouldn't work so well for an auto body repair garage.</li>

							<li>A logo for a law firm must communicate integrity and strength; not necessarily the look that would work well for a catering company.</li>
						</ul>
				</li>
